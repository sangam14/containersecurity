# Auditing Docker Security

DOCKER BENCH FOR SECURITY

Docker Bench for Security is an open source Bash script that checks for various common security best practices of deploying Docker in production environments. The tests are all automated and are based on the CIS Docker Benchmark. More information about Docker Bench for Security can be found
on GitHub: https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security


# auditing docker security with docker bench for security 


The auditing process can be performed by following the procedures outlined below:

1. You first need to clone the docker/docker-bench-security GitHub repository on your Docker host. This can be done by running the following command:


```
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
```
After cloning the repository, you will need to navigate into the docker-bench-security repository that you just cloned:

```
cd docker-bench-security


```

The cloned directory will contain a Bash script named docker-bench-security.sh. We can run this script to perform the Docker security audit by running the following command:

```
sudo ./docker-bench-security.sh
```

When the script is executed, it will perform all the necessary security checks. Once completed, it will provide you with a baseline security score as highlighted 

```

# Run the Docker daemon as a non-root user, if possible (Manual) 

The Docker containers by default run with the root privilege and so does the application that runs inside the container. This is another major concern from the security perspective because hackers can gain root access to the Docker host by hacking the application running inside the container.


Add user to Docker group

```
$ sudo groupadd docker
```
add your user to the docker group:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker [non-root user]

```

Using Dockerfile (USER instruction)

dit the Dockerfile that creates a non-root privilege user and modify the default root user to the newly-created non-root privilege user, as shown here:


```
##########################################
# Dockerfile to change from root to 
# non-root privilege
###########################################
# Base image is CentOS 7
FROM Centos:7
# Add a new user "sangam" with user id 8877
RUN useradd -u 8877 sangam
# Change to non-root privilege
USER sangam


```


Proceed to build the Docker image using the “docker build” subcommand, as depicted here:
```
sudo docker build -t nonrootimage .

```
 Finally, let’s verify the current user of our container using the id command in a docker run subcommand:

 ```
sudo docker run --rm nonrootimage id
 ```

# Ensure network traffic is restricted between containers on the default bridge
```
sudo docker network ls
